# Are those . . . more bias / variance conceptual questions??

### Before looking at the solution branch, check your answers against 
### someone else in the cohort



#### Fill in the following blanks for definitions of `bias` and `variance`

We have a situation where we have multiple samples and one algorithm.

For each sample, we train the algo on that sample, then make a prediction
for a single new observation the algo wasn't trained on

Let's define 'bias' and 'variance' in terms of the different predictions 
generated by the algo trained on different samples.

**Bias**: bias refers to the average _________

If we had a model with low bias, 
the average ________ would _________

If we had a model with high bias,
the average _________ would ________



**Variance**: variance refers to the average _________

If we had a model with low variance, 
the average ________ would _________

If we had a model with high variance,
the average ________ would _________
